# MilestoneProject1-TheMonkees

This is a project that allows users to access a library of The Monkees works, 
photos, and gain access to the social media of the band from the 60's

## UX

I wanted to make it a streamline site, with users experience as my main focus,
For Example as a fan of The Monkees I'd like to be able to hear their music,
watch some videos and find out about the band. So i've incorporated an About
and a Discography page. For users wanting a booking i've made a contact us page
and a list of "potential" dates for events around the globe.

My wireframes for this project can be found here https://app.moqups.com/r9Ff4a83jZ/view


## Features

### Header/Footer
This is my Navigation and Social link area, which allows users to manoeuvre around
the website and to explore the bands youtube/facebook etc..

### Landing Page
The home page is very simple but I think quite eyecatching, a photo of the band
and links to the rest of the website. At current there is only a single photo
on the carousel, i'd like to add more to this in future.

### About Page    
This page is dedicated to the history of the members of the band and 
how they formed/ met etc. this is a page for the people that would like to know
more about them rather than just listen to the band playing.
13/3 Added all information for the band and Band Members.

### Contact Page
This page is for fans requesting conversation or booking The Monkees for a private
function. This will contain testimonials from a couple of fans who have hired 
the band and will have a contact form requiring user input to function correctly.
The page thusfar has this capability and is !required for users to get a response.
