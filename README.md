# MilestoneProject1-TheMonkees

This is a project that allows users to access a library of The Monkees songs, 
photos, and gain access to the social media of the band from the 60's.
The project is intended to showcase my first skills in HTML and CSS. Whilst utilising
some additional plugins such as bootstrap.

## UX

I wanted to make it a streamline site, with users experience as my main focus,
For Example as a fan of The Monkees I'd like to be able to hear their music,
watch some videos and find out about the band. So i've incorporated an About
and a Discography page. 

For users wanting a booking i've made a contact us page and a list of "potential" dates 
for events around the globe, with a link through to a ticket site. This page also incorporates
a carousel of opensource imagery of concerts to emote a feeling of excitement from a potential
attendee.

For users wishing to contact and send fan mail, or to potentially book the band for a private 
function, i've included a contact form on the homepage.

My wireframes for this project can be found here https://app.moqups.com/r9Ff4a83jZ/view


## Features

### Header/Footer
This is my Navigation and Social link area, which allows users to manoeuvre around
the website and to explore the bands youtube/facebook etc..

### Landing Page
The home page is very simple but I think quite eyecatching, a photo of the band
and links to the rest of the website and a small amount of information about the 
other pages included. At current there is only a single photo
on the carousel, i'd like to add more to this in future.

### About Page    
This page is dedicated to the history of the members of the band and 
how they formed/ met etc. this is a page for the people that would like to know
more about them rather than just listen to the band playing.
13/3 Added all information for the band and Band Members.
20/3 All styles for the about page uploaded to the new format. More media responsivity.

for a *"tour"* that will redirect the user to an external ticket site

### Discography
This page contains media that allows the user to browse through a video,
and quite a few songs with information about that song and the time period 
available next to the image placeholder. This page is intended for users to 
reminisce about The Monkees
    
### REMOVED -- Contact Page --
I spent time looking at a few other bands websites, not the code just the way it was laid out
and with some feedback from my mentor have scrapped this page on this version.


## Features to be Implemented (Further from the project)
I have a few ideas of what to add to this project after I have submitted it,
such as:
1. A Calendar for the Events page, 
2. A more robust carousel on the front page, 
3. A better contact form, 
4. A more robust Discog library


## Technologies Used
I have utilised some additional technologies for this project.
1. BootStrap - This is used to streamline the development process and make use of pre-existing technologies for grouping and spacing my pages.
2. JavaScript & JQuery - These have been utilised for navbar transformations on media queries.
3. FontAwesome - Has been utilised for Iconography for Social Media links and ease of access.


## Testing
During building the website, I have done extensive testing to make sure that breakpoints and screen layout is as desired for my users.
I have made sure that all my links correctly work and the links to externals always open a new browser as to keep my site the focus.
For users wishing to watch and listen to the videos, the media controls all work properly and are easily visible on both mobile and large screen
For the users wishing to read up more about the band, the links to the social media pages of the band all lead directly to the websites, and to WIKIPEDIA.
For users wishing to contact the band, the contact form works properly and cannot be only partially filled. At current I cannot figure out how to send a "Complete" message.
