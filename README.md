# MilestoneProject1-TheMonkees

This is a project that allows users to access a library of The Monkees works, 
photos, and gain access to the social media of the band from the 60's

## UX

I wanted to make it a streamline site, with users experience as my main focus,
For Example as a fan of The Monkees I'd like to be able to hear their music,
watch some videos and find out about the band. So i've incorporated an About
and a Discography page. For users wanting a booking i've made a contact us page
and a list of "potential" dates for events around the globe.

My wireframes for this project can be found here https://app.moqups.com/r9Ff4a83jZ/view


## Features

### Header/Footer
This is my Navigation and Social link area, which allows users to manoeuvre around
the website and to explore the bands youtube/facebook etc..

###Landing Page###
The home page is very simple but I think quite eyecatching, a photo of the band
and links to the rest of the website. At current there is only a single photo
on the carousel, i'd like to add more to this in future.

### About Page    
This page is dedicated to the history of the members of the band and 
how they formed/ met etc. this is a page for the people that would like to know
more about them rather than just listen to the band playing.

### Contact Page
This page is for fans requesting conversation or booking The Monkees for a private
function. This will contain testimonials from a couple of fans who have hired 
the band and will have a contact form requiring user input to function correctly.

## Features to be implemented##
Please find below a short list of items yet to be implemented to the site.


### Events Page
This will contain a very simple photo carousel of events and a list of dates
for a *"tour"* that will redirect the user to an external ticket site
https://www.ticketmaster.com/the-monkees-tickets/artist/735678
 
### Discography
This page will contain media that allows the user to browse through a video,
and quite a few songs with information about that song and the time period 
available next to the image placeholder.
