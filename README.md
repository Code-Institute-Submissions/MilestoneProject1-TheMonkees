# MilestoneProject1-TheMonkees

This is a project that allows users to access a library of The Monkees works, 
photos, and gain access to the social media of the band from the 60's

## UX

I wanted to make it a streamline site, with users experience as my main focus,
For Example as a fan of The Monkees I'd like to be able to hear their music,
watch some videos and find out about the band. So i've incorporated an About
and a Discography page. For users wanting a booking i've made a contact us page
and a list of "potential" dates for events around the globe.

My wireframes for this project can be found here https://app.moqups.com/r9Ff4a83jZ/view


## Features

### Header/Footer
This is my Navigation and Social link area, which allows users to manoeuvre around
the website and to explore the bands youtube/facebook etc..

### Landing Page
The home page is very simple but I think quite eyecatching, a photo of the band
and links to the rest of the website and a small amount of information about the 
other pages included. At current there is only a single photo
on the carousel, i'd like to add more to this in future.

### About Page    
This page is dedicated to the history of the members of the band and 
how they formed/ met etc. this is a page for the people that would like to know
more about them rather than just listen to the band playing.
13/3 Added all information for the band and Band Members.

### Events Page
This contain's a very simple photo carousel of events and a list of dates
for a *"tour"* that will redirect the user to an external ticket site

### Discography
This page contains media that allows the user to browse through a video,
and quite a few songs with information about that song and the time period 
available next to the image placeholder. This page is intended for users to 
reminisce about The Monkees
    
### REMOVED -- Contact Page --
I spent time looking at a few other bands websites, not the code just the way it was laid out
and with some feedback from my mentor have scrapped this page on this version.


## Features to be Implemented (Further from the project)
I have a few ideas of what to add to this project after I have submitted it,
such as:
1. A Calendar for the Events page, 
2. A more robust carousel on the front page, 
3. A better contact form, 
4. A more robust Discog library


#### Notes 
Current WIP is the restyling from the first version, the differences can be seen in the now modified
main.html (formerly index.html) and the new index.html
