#MilestoneProject1-TheMonkees#

This is a project that allows users to access a library of The Monkees works, 
photos, and gain access to the social media of the band from the 60's

##UX##

I wanted to make it a streamline site, with users experience as my main focus,
For Example as a fan of The Monkees I'd like to be able to hear their music,
watch some videos and find out about the band. So i've incorporated an About
and a Discography page. For users wanting a booking i've made a contact us page
and a list of "potential" dates for events around the globe.

My wireframes for this project can be found here https://app.moqups.com/r9Ff4a83jZ/view


##Features##

###Header/Footer###
This is my Navigation and Social link area, which allows users to manoeuvre around
the website and to explore the bands youtube/facebook etc..

###Landing Page###
The home page is very simple but I think quite eyecatching, a photo of the band
and links to the rest of the website.
